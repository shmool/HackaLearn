# Organizing a HackaLearn Event

First and foremost, thank you for organizing a HackaLearn event! (Or, at least, considering it.)
This is a great opportunity to engage and bring value to your community. 
And we're not talking only about the awards :)

Please read the [participant guide](participant_guide.md) and [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## How does it work?

You know best what your community needs. Most of the logistics of organizing and managing the event are on you. 
We're bringing you the concept, content, platform and awards. 
Maybe we'll be able to help furthermore by joining as mentors or speakers, and amplifying the event on social media.

### Let's start with the basics. 

We suggest kickstarting the event by either a full day with hourly lightning talks and activities, or a 2-3 hours welcome and intro lectures.
During the first day the participants must 
- complete at least one Learn Module
- create a starter app, host it on GitHub and deploy with Azure Static Web Apps. 

Then, the participants have a whole week to work on their apps (alone or in groups), commit their changes (which will trigger deployment)
and write a post about their experience in social media.

### How to notify us about the event

1. Once you have set the date, time and concept, create an event page under the `Events 2021` folder.
Follow the [example event by Angular Nights](Events%202021/June_1_Angular_Nights.md) for naming the file and adding the details. 
You can add your own message to the community in that file. 
2. Create a pull request for adding the file. 
3. We may give you comments and suggestions before merging your file. We'll use the pull request page for our discussions.
4. You may change the file with more details. Submit a pull request each time you do.
5. Now it's all up to you - organizing and managing the event. We're here to help as much as we can.

### Our suggestions for a great event
- Engage community members to volunteer as mentors, speakers, moderators and co-organizers.
- If you have additional budget and/or sponsors, use them as you see fit. 
- Add constraints to the hackathon, such as using a specific framework or library.
- Encourage the participants to use the idea board to find a project to collaborate on.
- Schedule a closing session a week after the kickstart, where members can display their applications.
- Make a contest with winners in several categories. 


### Suggestions for contest categories
- Best looking app (design)
- Best UX
- Best idea (not necessarily fully implemented)
- Funniest group
- Most involved participant
