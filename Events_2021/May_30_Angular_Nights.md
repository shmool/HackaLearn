## Angular Nights is pleased to host HackaLearn 2021!
Angular Nights is proud to be the first community in the world hosting a HackaLearn!!

The event will be held in Hebrew. It's a full day online workshop kickstarting a week of hacking and learning.

## Registration
Please register in the [Angular Nights meetup event page](https://www.meetup.com/Angular-Nights/events/277128256/).

## What's a HackaLearn?
It's a Hackathon designed to learn new technologies, specifically Microsoft's Cloud (Azure, M365) services. It's led by the community. So in our case we're bringing to you both Angular and Azure.

During the HackaLearn you will work on your own web apps and complete Learn Modules. We start with a full day of online hands-on sessions and mentorship. Then you have a week to work on your amazing Angular app. We'll have another session to display your work and get prizes!

## Who is it for?
The Angular hands-on sessions will be for beginners in Angular. However, experienced Angularists can join as helpers and mentors! (And hack & learn like everyone else.)

Basic knowledge in HTML and JavaScript/TypeScript is required.

## Call for mentors
Do you have some experience with Angular and/or Azure? (Check out the specific list below.) We'd love your help and support in HackaLearn. You can answer questions and perform code reviews during the workshops on the first day and the whole week when the participants work on their apps. The main goal: bring your experience to empower and motivate the participants!
