## The Challenge - win an Azure Hero Kudos Badge

Azure Hero Badges are a fun way to earn digital **collectibles** for inclusive behaviour and meaningful impact in the technical community.
Each unique badger is very special and cryptographically secured by the blockchain (independent of the Azure Heroes programme) so it requires a blockchain wallet to safely store it.

To be eligible for the badge you must complete the following:
1. Deploy your web app on Azure Static Web Apps
2. Complete the [Cloud Skills Challenge](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/challenges?id=6d746470-9040-4664-a412-9d8384eef5db&WT.mc_id=javascript-35824-shjacobs&ocid=aid3039247)
3. Write about your experience in Social Media

**Once completed, send the links and your GitHub username to angular.nights@gmail.com, and you'll receive the Azure Kudos badger!**

You can also claim the Builder Badger when completing the tutorial and deploying your app on Azure, and the Learner Badger when completing Learn Modules. There are many more Badgers you can collect!
