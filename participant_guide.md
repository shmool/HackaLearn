# Welcome to HackaLearn 2021!

Here's everything you need to know to participate and be eligable for awards. 

The HackaLearn starts with a kickoff event, followed by a whole week for working on the applications.

## Your HackaLearn event
Each HackaLearn event is organized within a community. 
The events vary in length, content, and more. 
The event may add awards and prizes with other requisites.
Check your event page for more details.

## Checklist for winning awards

During the first 8 hours you must 
- create a GitHub repo (public or private) for your application
- deploy your application with [Azure Static Web Apps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/app-service/static/?WT.mc_id=javascript-20968-shjacobs) (you may need to [open an Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/open-source/?WT.mc_id=javascript-20968-shjacobs) for this)
- Complete one Learn Module from the [HackaLearn Learning Path]() (or another one if you've done them before)
- [Create an issue](../../issues) in this repo providing links to the achievements listed above using the [achievements template]().

Within 7 days you must
- deploy another version of your application (hopefully a working version of your app)
- write about your experience in social media, tagging [HackaLearn](#list_of_hackalearn_social_media_accounts) and [Azure Static Web Apps]()
- comment on the issue you've created providing a link to the post you've just published

We'll track the issues and send you an Azure Hero badger with instructions to claim your award.

## Hacking in groups
You may join a group for building the application. 
This means there's probably one repository of the application and all the group members are collaborators. 
Still, we want you to experience working with Azure Static Web Apps even with just a starter application. 
To be eligable for the award, you must complete all the items in the checklist by yourself, with one adjustment: 
Within 7 days you must provide a link to the group's application and commit at least one contribution to the code (preferrably using pull request).
