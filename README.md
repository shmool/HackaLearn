# HackaLearn

Hack & Learn & turn your ideas into reality

### Check out the [latest news](news.md) for upcoming events and call for mentors and speakers.

## What's HackaLearn?
HackaLearn is a community event which combines several methods to grow: learning, practicing and engaging. 
During a HackaLearn the participants complete [Learn Modules](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/?WT.mc_id=javascript-20968-shjacobs) and use the newly gained knowledge to develop applications.

The ideas for the applications can come from the participants or anywhere else. As in many hackathons, there are awards. 🎁 

HackaLearns are organized by tech communities. Usually there's a kickoff event spanning an evening or a whole day. Then the participants can work on their ideas and continue learning for another week. Finally, the participants will come together again for a show-off session. 🤩

The organizers know best how to involve and engage their community members, so they can adopt the idea and tweak it as necessary. 
We ([Microsoft Cloud Advocates](https://developer.microsoft.com/advocates/?WT.mc_id=javascript-20968-shjacobs)) are here to suggest the basic structure, resources, rewards, and our help as much as we can.

### Hack
Bring your own idea or get inspired by others' in the [idea board](../../labels/app%20idea). Team up with a group or hack by yourself. Whatever works for you at the moment.

Build a Web Application and deploy it with [Azure Static Web Apps (Preview)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/static-web-apps/overview?WT.mc_id=javascript-20968-shjacobs).

You can use additional services by Azure ([Cosmos DB](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cosmos-db/?WT.mc_id=javascript-20968-shjacobs), [SignalR](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet/signalr/?WT.mc_id=javascript-20968-shjacobs), etc.), Microsoft ([M365 with Graph Toolkit](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/m365-msgraph-toolkit/?WT.mc_id=javascript-20968-shjacobs), [Power Platform](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/?WT.mc_id=javascript-20968-shjacobs), etc.) or third-party.

Each community or event can focus on a specific framework or service (i.e. Angular, GraphQL). We have no constraints here. 

### Learn
Microsoft offers a sandbox platform with hands-on tutorials where you can learn how to use its services. It's called [Microsoft Learn](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/?WT.mc_id=javascript-20968-shjacobs). 
You can select specific Learn Modules of your choice or select a path with suggested Learn Modules. 
There's no need to sign in to use the platform. Howerver, when you sign in there are more features available to you, such as tracking your progress, accruing points and achievements, using free Azure resources and viewing personalized recommendations. 

We're suggesting relevant [learning paths and modules](learnin.md) for HackaLearn. Whether completing the suggested modules or ones of your choice, this is one of the requisites for [winning awards](#awards).

In addition to Learn Modules we encourage to follow other tutorials, read docs and blog posts, watch videos etc. We have a [list of suggested resources](../../labels/resource) to which you can add your favorite posts, videos and tutorials.

### Engage
Tutorials and hands-on are great, but another essential piece of the puzzle of growing is enaging within the community.
We encourage sharing your questions, learnings, ideas, knowledge and experience to inspire and empower your community members. 
[Start a discussion](../../issues/new?labels=community%20discussion) in the message board or any other channel of communication within your event.

Some events will have mentors, lightning talks, and various activities to get you focused and motivated. Check out the [news section](#news) to find call for speakers and mentors.
