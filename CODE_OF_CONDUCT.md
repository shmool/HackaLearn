# Code of Conduct

HackaLearn is a world-wide program designed for empowering community members. 
We demand respectful communication in all forms of conversation, on any topic or matter, 
including people, concepts and other subjects that are outside the scope of the community. 

As a Microsoft-managed community, HackaLearn has adopted the [Microsoft Open Source Code of
Conduct](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/). 

This is a short version adopted to the HackaLearn project. 
Please make sure to read the [full version](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/). 

**This code of conduct outlines expectations for participation in the HackaLearn community, as well as steps for reporting unacceptable behavior. We are committed to providing a welcoming and inspiring community for all. **

## 3rd party communities

Communities that adopt the HackaLearn program are responsible for displaying their own code of conduct, 
as well as contact details for questions and violation reports.

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to act and interact in ways 
that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our
community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes,
  and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the
  overall community

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.

This Code of Conduct also applies to actions taken outside of these spaces, and which have a negative impact on community health.  

## Enforcement and Reporting

We encourage all communities to resolve issues on their own whenever possible.

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the HackaLearn community leaders responsible for enforcement: 
- [Shmuela Jacobs](shmuela.jacobs@microsoft.com)

For higher level enforcement please report to opencode@microsoft.com.
Your report will be handled in accordance with the issue resolution process described in the [Code of Conduct FAQ](FAQ.md).

All project and community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the
reporter of any incident.
