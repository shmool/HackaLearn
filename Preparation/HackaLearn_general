# Prerequizites for HackaLearn

To enjoy HackaLearn please come with your computer set up with the following:

1. Node.js
2. npm
3. Git
4. GitHub account
5. IDE (VS-Code for instance)

See further instructions below.

Further prerequisites are subject to the specific event. For instance, framework installation.

## Azure
In addition, you will be working with Azure. You can open a free account with $200 credit. 
Some events may supply Azure Passes with which you can open an account with fewer steps (no credit card required). 
The passes have a limited lifetime, and you can transform the account to a regular free account (with the $200 credit) afterwards. 

## Node.js and npm

Node.js allows running JavaScript code on your computer. 
Not only does it help when developing servers locally, but it enables many tools that Web-developers work with. 

Node.js comes with npm built in.

Check whether you have the latest version of Node.js and npm. Some tools require a minimal version (you may get an error message when trying to install them).

Install Node.js from the official website: https://nodejs.org/
